# Stand Clear [of the closing doors]

## Backend

A go backend that interfaces with the MTA API and answers the question, when's the next train?

### Running

Can use `go run .` after cloning to start the web server OR
`go build .` to build an executable to start the web server

By default, this runs on localhost on port 8080, but you can change it.
